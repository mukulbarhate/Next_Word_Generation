# Next Word Generation using LSTM and Word Embeddings
# Project Overview
This project implements a Next Word Generation model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and word embeddings. The model predicts the next word in a sentence based on the given input sequence of words. The project showcases the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a predictive text model, similar to the ones used in smartphone keyboards and other text completion systems.

# Features
Word Embeddings: The model utilizes pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec) to convert words into dense vectors that capture semantic meanings and relationships.

LSTM Network: An LSTM layer is employed to capture the temporal dependencies and context of the input word sequence, making it effective for generating the next word in a sentence.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on a large corpus of text data to learn language patterns and structures. Evaluation metrics are used to assess the model's performance on predicting the next word.

User Interface: A simple UI is built using Flask, allowing users to input a sequence of words and receive the predicted next word.

Deployment: The application is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, making it accessible as a web service.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for data processing, model building, and deployment.
Keras/TensorFlow: Deep learning libraries used to build and train the LSTM model.
Flask: Web framework used to create the user interface and handle HTTP requests.
AWS EC2: Cloud platform used to deploy and host the application.
NLP Libraries: NLTK, Gensim, or SpaCy for text preprocessing and word embeddings.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Text data is tokenized, cleaned, and transformed into sequences. Word embeddings are applied to convert words into numerical vectors.

Model Training: The LSTM model is trained on these sequences to learn the context and predict the next word. The training process involves backpropagation and optimization to minimize prediction errors.

Prediction: Given an input sequence of words, the trained model predicts the most likely next word by evaluating the learned patterns.

Deployment: The model is integrated with a Flask-based web interface, allowing users to interact with the model in real-time.
